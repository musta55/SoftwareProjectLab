Emotion Detection API can accurately detect the emotion from any textual data.
People voice their opinion, feedback and reviews on social media, blogs and forums.
Marketers and customer support can leverage the power of Emotion Detection to read and analyze emotions attached with the textual data.

Sometimes the three classes of sentiment (positive, negative and neutral) are not sufficient to understand the nuances regarding the underlying tone of a sentence.
Our Emotion Analysis classifier is trained on our proprietary dataset and tells whether the underlying emotion behind a message is: Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Excited or Bored.
